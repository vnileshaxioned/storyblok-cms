title: Storyblok Local Setup
---

# Progress

- I have started and configured a sample project of Storyblok on my local system.
- During the local system setup of Storyblok, I created various components and page content.
- Additionally, I thoroughly examined and tested several custom field types to ensure their functionality.

# Could be picked in next week

- The next step is to selecting a project, then set up Storyblok on the local system.
- This involves implementing the necessary code to fetch components and integrate them into the frontend of the project.
